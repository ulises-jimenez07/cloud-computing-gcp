# GCP Cloud Computing Examples

A practical collection of Google Cloud Platform examples covering data processing, serverless computing, and machine learning workflows.

## What's Inside

This repository demonstrates real-world implementations of core GCP services:

**Data Processing**
- [dataflow_example/](dataflow_example/) - Apache Beam pipelines for batch and streaming data processing with Dataflow
- [dataproc_example/](dataproc_example/) - Managed Spark and Hadoop clusters for distributed computing
- [pub_sub/](pub_sub/) - Real-time messaging with ordered audio streaming simulation

**Serverless & Applications**
- [crf_example/](crf_example/) - Cloud Run Functions with Vertex AI for document processing
- [app_engine/](app_engine/) - Multi-service Flask applications with traffic splitting

**Analytics & ML**
- [big_query/](big_query/) - Data warehousing, BigQuery ML models, and Looker Studio dashboards

**Reference Materials**
- [commands-executed.md](commands-executed.md) - Comprehensive gcloud CLI reference for common operations
- [AI_ML_script.sh](AI_ML_script.sh) - Scripts for Vision API, Language API, and Vertex AI workflows

## Getting Started

Each example directory contains its own README with setup instructions and requirements. Most examples require:
- An active GCP project with billing enabled
- Appropriate API access and IAM permissions
- Python 3.9+ and relevant dependencies

Check individual example directories for specific setup steps and usage instructions.
